This is Math Dept. Team Alpha, checking in from Auburn, AL.

*Toomer's Corner being rolled*

Here at Auburn, we love our traditions. And one of our most unique traditions,
is the rolling of Toomer's Corner.

*Toomer's Drugs*

According to AuburnTigers.com,
the tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner is said to have begun when Toomer's
Drugs had the only telegraph in the city. After Auburn University
would win a football
game on the road, employees of our local drug store would throw the ticker
tape from the telegraph onto the power lines. At some point down the line,
Auburn fans joined in by throwing toilet paper, and the rest is history.

*Toomer's Corner being rolled*

Teams at the Auburn, AL Hackathon competition were prompted with several
suggestions, one of which was to take advantage of the live feed of
Toomer's Corner provided by the City of Auburn. What started as a joke
amongst our team of mathematicians quickly turned serious: using a little
bit of calculus, we could programmatically identify when Auburn's famous
corner is littered with celebratory TP.
